# About libraries
**pyttsx3: Python Text To Speech | pyttsx module**
* pyttsx is a cross-platform text to speech library which is platform independent. The major advantage of using this library for text-to-speech conversion is that it works offline. However, pyttsx supports only Python 2.x. Hence, we will see pyttsx3 which is modified to work on both Python 2.x and Python 3.x with the same code.

**PyPDF2: Working with PDF files in Python**
